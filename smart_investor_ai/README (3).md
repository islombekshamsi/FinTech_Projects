#  Smart Investor
Howdy!

I decided to build Smart Investor AI. Smart Investor is an AI-driven portfolio generator built with Python and Streamlit. It helps users design custom investment plans based on their risk tolerance, strategy preference, and desired diversification - powered by real-time market data from [Twelve Data](https://twelvedata.com/).


Feel free to test it out, reach out or collaborate!

Happy Coding!


ps1 i have attached a screenshot file of the expected look of the software

ps2 i have removed my api key from the utils.py, but it is very easy to get your api key, just sign up to Twelve Data and get your free api key. but if you are on free trial, it might take longer to get real time data.
