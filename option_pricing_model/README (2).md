#  Option Pricing Simulator (Monte Carlo + Black-Scholes)

Howdy!

After finishing STAT318, I decided to make a hands on project using the theory I have learnt. This project implements European option pricing using two methods:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulates thousands of stock price paths to estimate the fair price of a call option.
- **Black-Scholes Formula**: Closed-form solution for pricing European call options.

It includes a **Jupyter Notebook** for exploration, and an interactive **Streamlit app** for real-time pricing.


Feel free to test it out, reach out or collaborate!

Happy Coding!
